### **Frontend Architecture**
- **React.js Client** deployed using AWS services.
- **Amazon S3** for hosting static content.
- **CloudFront** as a CDN for fast and global content delivery.
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)** for SSL/TLS certificates to secure communication.
- **Route 53** for DNS management and domain routing.

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Node.js Express API** containerized and stored in **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**.
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** with **Fargate** for serverless, containerized deployment.
- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** to distribute incoming traffic efficiently.
- **Secrets Manager** to manage sensitive environment variables like private keys securely.

### **Database Architecture**
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** with **Postgres** for structured data storage.
- RDS is configured with automated backups, scaling, and multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

### **Media Storage & Delivery**
- **Amazon S3** for storing avatar images.
- **CloudFront** for caching and globally distributing images.
- **Secrets Manager** for securely retrieving private keys to generate CloudFront signed URLs.

### **Security & Compliance**
- **IAM Roles & Policies** to enforce least privilege access.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** for secure networking and resource isolation.
- **Security Groups** to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** implemented to allow controlled API access.

### **Scalability & Reliability**
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for backend services to handle varying traffic loads.
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring logs, performance metrics, and system health.
- **ECS Task Scheduling** for managing long-running background processes.



## CI/CD Pipeline

### Unit Testing:
- Emphasis on writing unit tests for backend API calls and frontend components.
- All unit tests must pass before merging any changes into the main branch to ensure functionality and stability.

### Deployment with GitHub Actions:
- **Frontend**: The React client is compiled and sent to an **S3 bucket**, followed by invalidating the **CloudFront** cache to deliver updated content.
- **Backend**: Docker images are uploaded to **ECR** and deployed through **ECS** using Fargate, ensuring the latest changes are live.
